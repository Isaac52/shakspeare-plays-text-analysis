## Description
This is a R Shiny application that analyzes the text from three of Shakespeare's plays. The three plays are A Mid Summer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice, and Romeo and Juliet. The app will allow you to select one play at a time to analyzes. Once the desired play is selected a play button will then need to be clicked for the app to generate the word cloud and word count plots. Furthermore, once the plots are generated then you'll have specific action that will adjust each plot. For the world cloud you'll have the ability to keep or remove stop words from the text. Next, there are three scroll bars that will allow you to adjust the number of words that are visible in the plot. As well as, adjust the size of the largest and smallest words in the word cloud plot. For the word count plot you'll have the ability to keep or remove stop words, adjust number of words that are visible on the plot, and adjust the font size to the axis labels. 

* If running the code is not your cup of tea, the ShinyApp.io link is at the bottom of the page in the Author info! This will allow you to run the app in the browser.  HAVE FUN!
